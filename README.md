# Mega-Mart-Sales-Analysis

## 📝Problem Statement:
"Mega Market" a leading retail company, has accumulated extensive sales data over the past three years. However, this data remains largely untapped, lacking detailed analysis that could reveal critical business insights. The absence of actionable insights hinders strategic decision-making, particularly in understanding how different factors such as geographical zones, customer education levels, and gender impact revenue.

## 🎯Project Outcome

The project aims to design a Power BI dashboard that visualizes revenue distribution across various dimensions, including zones, education levels, and gender, providing the necessary insights to drive informed business decisions.
